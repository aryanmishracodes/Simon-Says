SimonSays Game - A Memory Challenge
Overview
SimonSays is an engaging, memory-based game designed to challenge and enhance cognitive skills. Players are presented with a sequence of lights that blink in a random order. The objective is to remember and replicate the sequence by clicking the lights in the correct order. With each successful round, the game becomes progressively more difficult, adding additional lights to the sequence. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing dynamic interaction and responsiveness.
